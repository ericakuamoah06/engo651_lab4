# Project 4 Traffic Incident

ENGO 651 - ERIC aKUAMOAH

### Project Description

This project adds an additional layer that shows traffic incident data to the mapping interface that was first developed in Lab 3 for the website for construction permits in Calgary. With the use of a particular layer control function, users of this enhanced web application can turn the traffic incidents layer on or off. Users can still search for building permits with full access to the functionality, even when the traffic incidents layer is not enabled.
